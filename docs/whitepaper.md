# Lithon Whitepaper

Seed content from `docs/lithon_error_system.md` (section 4c): the error-code
table. Every code below should eventually grow a one-paragraph entry here.

## Error code table

Grouped by tier — the first digit after `E` names the tier, making "what
kind of failure is this" readable from the code alone.

| Code | Tier | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `E0101` | 1 (static refusal) | Overflow on reassignment |
| `E0102` | 1 (static refusal) | Literal zero divisor |
| `E0103` | 1 (static refusal) | Literal shift out of range |
| `E0104` | 1 (static refusal) | Literal-provable capacity overflow |
| `E0105` | 1 (static refusal) | Unsupported type width |
| `E0201` | 2 (environmental) | Fallible value read before `.ok` check |
| `E0301` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Division by zero |
| `E0302` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Modulo by zero |
| `E0303` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Dynamic integer overflow |
| `E0304` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Shift amount out of range |
| `E0305` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Dynamic index/capacity out of range |
| `E0306` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Invalid integer literal in input |
| `E0307` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | Input value outside the target width |
| `E0308` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap) | End of input |
| `E0401` | 3 (dynamic runtime trap, resource) | Stack overflow |
