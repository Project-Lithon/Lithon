// Per-platform register roles for Lithon's x86-64 JIT.
//
// Both supported host ABIs are handled here so the rest of the code
// generator never mentions an OS:
//
//                   System V (Linux/macOS)       Microsoft x64 (Windows)
//   integer args    rdi, rsi, ...                rcx, rdx, r8, r9
//   callee-saved    rbx rbp r12-r15              rbx rbp rdi rsi r12-r15 (+xmm6-15)
//   shadow space    none                         32 bytes above the return address
//
// Register roles chosen so BOTH ABIs are satisfied by one design:
//   * promoted variables live in {rbx, r12-r15}: callee-saved on both
//     ABIs, so they survive calls into printf/other JIT functions.
//     Each function saves/restores the ones it uses in its own frame.
//   * temporaries live in a caller-saved pool that never contains an
//     argument register, so marshalling call arguments can never
//     clobber a source operand.
//   * r10 / r11 are permanent scratch (never allocated to a value):
//     r10 = left operand / spilled result, r11 = right operand /
//     indirect call target. Caller-saved on both ABIs.
//   * rdi/rsi are never touched on Windows (callee-saved there).

// SSE2 double-precision register roles.
//
// A structurally separate pool from the GP pools above, not an
// extension of kPromotionPool: an XMM register holds 128 bits of
// double-precision data and shares no storage with a 64-bit GP
// register, so a float value can never occupy a slot that a GP
// temporary is using. Mixing them in one array would make every
// existing "is this slot free?" query wrong.
//
//   * float temporaries live in XMM0-XMM5: all caller-saved on BOTH
//     ABIs, so they never need saving, and none is an argument
//     register, so marshalling printf's double in XMM0 can never
//     clobber a source operand.
//   * XMM6-XMM15 are callee-saved on Microsoft x64 ONLY. On System V every
//     XMM register is caller-saved. This is the one place the two ABIs
//     genuinely disagree, so the float TEMPORARY pool stays inside XMM0-XMM5.
//     NOTE: the reserved scratch registers below (XMM12-XMM15) are outside
//     that pool, so on Windows a function that writes them must save and
//     restore them in its prologue/epilogue. That is NOT implemented yet.
//   * XMM6/XMM7 would additionally be wrong on SysV as promotion
//     registers for a different reason: nothing in the current design
//     needs six simultaneously-live float temporaries.
//   * XMM15 is reserved as the permanent scratch, mirroring how r10
//     and r11 are reserved on the GP side. Caller-saved on System V; on
//     Microsoft x64 it is callee-saved (see the note above).
